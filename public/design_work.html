        This is a UX design made for elder accesibility in a University of
        Washington class. After doing some user research I learned that these
        two predominant colors, <em id="orange-em">orange</em> and
        <em id="blue-em">blue</em>, help the elders to attain satisfaction in
        health and happiness. This application uses signifiers and constraints
        to help the elder experience with new technology.

        This is a design we created as a group in the design methods class. We
        were aiming for an app in which people could search for social problems
        they wanted to help with.

        This design was made for the startup Bump that I am starting with 3
        other classmates. Bump into experiences. The aim of the app is to use
        cards to display physical experiences wiithin Seattle from the
        perspective of the people that already live there. This with the purpose
        to maximize your experience in the city or, if you are new to the city,
        make yourself feel at home as soon as possible. We understand that
        experiences don't mean anything if you don't have people the share them
        with so we also decided to use a novel approach of, in case the user
        registers for the feature, we create groups of users using AI to cluster
        them depending on what they thrive for. Bump into experiences, bump into
        new friendships.
